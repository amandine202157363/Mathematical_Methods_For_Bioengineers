~ Maths_CW1: plot the fluorescence time series for cell 1 - subplot angular position of the mouse as a function of time - plot trajectory of the mouse in space (Cartesian coordinates) - plot average response of this cell at each radial position - produce delay embedding with time lag - recurrence plot - plot cell's activity as an image - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 

~ Maths_CW2: plot matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients (PPMCC) - plot adjency matrix - compute average degree of network - global average clustering coefficient - plot the degree distribution for the network 

~ Maths_CW3: fluorescence time series into event train (binary process) - plot  continuous fluorescence time series with time - times of detected events marked by a tick over or under-laid on the same plot - plot rastergram - mutual information - binning - Shannon formula - spatial information rates - plot distribution
